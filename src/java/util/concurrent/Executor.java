/**
 * An object that executes submitted {@link Runnable} tasks. This
 * interface provides a way of decoupling task submission from the
 * mechanics of how each task will be run, including details of thread
 * use, scheduling, etc.  An {@code Executor} is normally used
 * instead of explicitly creating threads. For example, rather than
 * invoking {@code new Thread(new(RunnableTask())).start()} for each
 * of a set of tasks, you might use:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Executor executor = <em>anExecutor</em>;
 * executor.execute(new RunnableTask1());
 * executor.execute(new RunnableTask2());
 * ...
 * </pre>
 *
 * However, the {@code Executor} interface does not strictly
 * require that execution be asynchronous. In the simplest case, an
 * executor can run the submitted task immediately in the caller's
 * thread:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class DirectExecutor implements Executor {
 *   public void execute(Runnable r) {
 *     r.run();
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * More typically, tasks are executed in some thread other
 * than the caller's thread.  The executor below spawns a new thread
 * for each task.
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class ThreadPerTaskExecutor implements Executor {
 *   public void execute(Runnable r) {
 *     new Thread(r).start();
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * Many {@code Executor} implementations impose some sort of
 * limitation on how and when tasks are scheduled.  The executor below
 * serializes the submission of tasks to a second executor,
 * illustrating a composite executor.
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class SerialExecutor implements Executor {
 *   final Queue<Runnable> tasks = new ArrayDeque<Runnable>();
 *   final Executor executor;
 *   Runnable active;
 *
 *   SerialExecutor(Executor executor) {
 *     this.executor = executor;
 *   }
 *
 *   public synchronized void execute(final Runnable r) {
 *     tasks.offer(new Runnable() {
 *       public void run() {
 *         try {
 *           r.run();
 *         } finally {
 *           scheduleNext();
 *         }
 *       }
 *     });
 *     if (active == null) {
 *       scheduleNext();
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   protected synchronized void scheduleNext() {
 *     if ((active = tasks.poll()) != null) {
 *       executor.execute(active);
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * The {@code Executor} implementations provided in this package
 * implement {@link ExecutorService}, which is a more extensive
 * interface.  The {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} class provides an
 * extensible thread pool implementation. The {@link Executors} class
 * provides convenient factory methods for these Executors.
 *
 * <p>Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to
 * submitting a {@code Runnable} object to an {@code Executor}
 * <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
 * its execution begins, perhaps in another thread.

 *   Java线程既是工作单元，也是执行机制。从JDK 5开始，把工作单元与执行机制分离开
 * 来。工作单元包括 Runnable 和 Callable，而执行机制由 Executor 框架提供。
 *
 * 在 HotSpot VM 的线程模型中，Java线程（java.lang.Thread）被一对一映射为本地操作系统线程。
 * Java线程启动时会创建一个本地操作系统线程；当该Java线程终止时，这个操作系统线程也会被回收。
 * 操作系统会调度所有线程并将它们分配给可用的CPU。
 *
 * 在上层，Java多线程程序通常把应用分解为若干个任务，然后使用用户级的调度器
 * （Executor框架）将这些任务映射为固定数量的线程；
 * 在底层，操作系统内核将这些线程映射到硬件处理器上。
